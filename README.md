# Point Cash

Point Cash is a Python terminal program which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can manage money through the Python terminal choosing deposit, withdraw, transfer and check balance.

Here is the live version of my project. - https://cash-point-2ee1f9c68969.herokuapp.com/

### Future Features

- The Google sheet is already synchronized with the program and I would like to set up account number and PIN to start the program, like a real ATM machine.
- Allow more options
- Allow aditional languages

### Testing

- I have tested this program by doing:

    - Passed the code through a PEP8 Linter, fixed and confirmed that there are no problems.
    - Tested in my own terminal and the CI Heroku terminal.
    - Given invalid inputs: when the number does not match the option and different amounts.

### Bugs

- Solved bugs

    - When I wrote my project and ran it with python3 run.py sometimes showed up this message
    
    “File "run.py", line 30
     else:
     ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax”

    - which now I know it is in line 30, the problem would be with "else" and I have to investigate.

### Remaining Bugs

- No bugs remaining

### Validator Testing

- PEP8
    - No errors were returned form PEP8online.com
