# Point Cash

Point Cash is a Python terminal program which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can manage money through the Python terminal choosing deposit, withdraw, transfer and check balance.

Here is the live version of my project. - https://cash-point-2ee1f9c68969.herokuapp.com/

### Future Features

- The Google sheet is already synchronized with the program and I would like to set up account number and PIN to start the program, like a real ATM machine.
- Allow more options
- Allow aditional languages
